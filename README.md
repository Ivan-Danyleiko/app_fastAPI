Asynchronous FastAPI with SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
Project Overview
This project is an API built on the FastAPI framework, leveraging asynchronous processing for efficient request handling. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database using the SQLAlchemy ORM to provide fast and reliable operation.

Installation and Running
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system.
Install Dependencies: Run poetry install to install the required dependencies.
Database Configuration: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and configure the connection settings in the config.py file.
Run the Server: Execute poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload to start the server. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
Usage
To use the API, follow the endpoints described below:

Create a New Contact: Send a POST request to /contacts with the contact details in the request body.
Get All Contacts: Send a GET request to /contacts to retrieve a list of all contacts.
Get a Contact by ID: Send a GET request to /contacts/{contact_id} to retrieve a specific contact by its ID.
Update a Contact: Send a PUT request to /contacts/{contact_id} with the updated contact details in the request body.
Delete a Contact: Send a DELETE request to /contacts/{contact_id} to delete a contact by its ID.
Project Architecture
The project architecture consists of the following components:

FastAPI: The web framework used for building the API endpoints and handling requests.
SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system.
uvicorn: An ASGI server implementation, used to run the FastAPI application.
